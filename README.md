# New Dish, Who Dis

[Live](https://the-chioma.github.io/FirstProject/)

An Inspired by the current global pandemic, with the increase of more people at home and cooking we wanted to create an app to make those experiences more fun

We wanted to give people the chance to be inspired by recipes they may never have come across before in their normal recipe searches.  Our app will present a recipe inspired by a country with an Image of the flag for that country.

## User Story
As a user, I want to search for a new recipe.

After I select my preferred continents and click on the submit button.

Then I am presented with a randomly selected recipe inspired by a country from my chosen continents.

I am also presented with the flag of the country, the country the dish is inspired by, the name of the dish, an image of the dish, the ingredients required to make the dish and its recipe.

I can save my favourite recipes by clicking the save button which is displayed on the screen.

When I click on the save button, I am asked to confirm if I want to save the displayed recipe.

When I click “Yes”, my recipe is saved to local storage.

A “Saved Recipes” button appears and when I click that, I am presented with my saved recipes.
